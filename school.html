            I am currently building an application with 3 other CPrE majors to diagnose learning style.
            It presents users with various quizzes and allows a professor to evalute their learning style
            based upon how much time the student spent on various supplementary materials.

          My Junior year I worked with 3 other CPrE majors to build an application called BlueText.
          This application works with Mac, and Windows Operating Systems and connects to an Android Phone.
          When you receive a text message on your phone, this text message is sent to your computer, and you
          are able to reply if you so desire.

        This project taught me about threading and the android operating system. It allowed me to
        strengthen my knowledge of the development lifecycle, and prepared me for the workforce.

          <p>
            My freshman year at Iowa State I worked with three other CPrE majors to build an application called
            the Kinect GamePack. It allows up to two players to play tic-tac-toe together using body movements to select
            squares, and also includes poker with a single human player against three computer players. Each of the
            computer players determined a strength of hand based upon the odds of them successfully aquiring various hands,
            then modified that number by considering chip lead, table strength, and betting history. Once this final number
            was calculated we used a random number generator and the strengh to determine if it should call, raise or fold.
            We all worked on the initial Kinect integration together, then my primary responsiblility for the rest of the
            project was to design the AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project taught me a lot about build algorithms that can take into account many variables, and it
            was an interesting way to learn how to interpret and use an unfamiliar interface.
            I learned how to work in C# and how to build my first project without specific requirements.

          <p>
            My fresman year I built a simulated vending machine using an Altera Cyclone II board.
            This "vending machine" allowed users to "insert" quarters, dimes, or nickels using the coresponding buttons
            on the board, then select an item to be vended using the switches. Throughout this process, the 7-segment display
            was continually updated with the money left.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project taught me the value of verilog. First, I tried to complete the circuit by using a circuit diagram
            and a lot of wires. However, debugging this mess of wires was awful. However, when I tried it again
            using verilog it was much more simple. I also learned the value of splitting up projects into small, easily
            testable modules.
